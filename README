# Helicoprion Keyboard

The Helicoprion Keyboard is a 52-key diodeless, flippable, choc spaced, hotswap, aggressive column staggered, split keyboard powered by Pro Micro pin compatible board, eg a nice!nano or a KB2040.
It does not support wireless controllers, but you can use a nice!nano wired if you want

# Inspiration

* [Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) The main inspiration is from the ferris sweep I started trying to used I needed more keys.
* [Hillside](https://github.com/mmccoyd/hillside) The very pretty promicro foot print and how to wire it.
* [Torn](https://github.com/rtitmuss/torn) For not be afraid of showing th components and that look can be very sexy.

## Features

* Pro Micro MCU - Many options
* Sweep inspired layout - Ergonomic strong column staggering for short pinkies.
* Extra pinky column - for those not too often used keys.
* Flippable PCBs - Cheaper to order the PCBs
* Hotswap low profile choc switches - Experiment with different key switches with the hotswap sockets.
* Very large thumb cluster - Let your thumb do more of the work.
* Both SMD and THT diodes - Pick if you want the easier to solder or the smaller diodes.
